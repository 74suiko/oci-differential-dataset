# youki-3186

## Upstream Issue Summary
- Title: [Bug]: Check if hook order is correct
- URL: https://github.com/youki-dev/youki/issues/3186
- Category: POSIX-platform Hooks
- Summary: This case reduces the upstream issue to a small OCI bundle that can be used for differential runtime testing.

## Runtime Version Assessment
Use the runtime version discussed in the upstream issue as the affected implementation and compare it with a fixed or reference runtime. Some cases require specific host support such as cgroup v1, cgroup v2, seccomp, eBPF device filtering, user namespaces, or hook execution support.

## Buggy Version Identification
Issue text does not name a precise release in the available local data. Git log matched `f60f41780507` (`fix hook order (#3256)`); use parent `9b884120c39e` as the pre-fix buggy baseline.

## Local Reproduction Files
- `base_config.json`: clean OCI configuration before injecting the issue-specific payload.
- `buggy_config.json`: modified OCI configuration containing the payload.
- `repro.sh`: helper script that prepares a temporary OCI bundle, extracts `../../alpine-base.tar.gz`, copies the selected config to `config.json`, and invokes the runtime.
- `expected_diff.txt`: expected behavioral difference and validation oracle.
- `README.md`: this case description.

## Reproduction Prerequisites
- Linux host with permission to run OCI runtimes.
- `alpine-base.tar.gz` present in the repository root.
- Runtime binary available on `PATH` or passed with `RUNTIME=/path/to/runtime`.
- Case-specific kernel or cgroup features available when required by `expected_diff.txt`.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Change into `cases/youki-3186`.
2. Run `bash repro.sh` with the default runtime.
3. Compare implementations by rerunning with explicit binaries, for example `RUNTIME=/path/to/reference-runtime bash repro.sh` and `RUNTIME=/path/to/buggy-runtime bash repro.sh`.
4. Check the clean baseline with `CONFIG=base_config.json bash repro.sh` when useful.
5. Compare exit code, stdout, stderr, and side effects against `expected_diff.txt`.

## Result Validation
Payload: process args: ["sh", "-c", "cat /hook.log"]; hooks: prestart, createContainer

Oracle: Run the same buggy_config.json with a reference runtime and an affected runtime. A valid reproduction is a stable difference in exit status, stdout, stderr, runtime state, or documented side effects for the same OCI payload.
